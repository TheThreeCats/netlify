This website is created to share algorithmic tutorials for free. I created this as a hobby project while trying to dabble with front end. I am a back end developer in my day job. I have three years of work experience with Java, primarily in developing enterprise applications using Spring, DropWizard, and apache spark. Feel free to reach out to me on thethreecats021@gmail.com. 

The name **theThreeCats** is because I have three cats as pets and they kept me company while trying to work on this site.
